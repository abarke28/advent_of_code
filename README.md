# Advent Of Code

Solutions for Advent of Code problems.

Details: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)

A daily coding challenge for each day in December leading up to Christmas. Each day & challenge consists of two related problems.
This is my first year doing this.

To solve a problem, run:

`dotnet run [year_number] <day_number>`

The default year is 2022.

To generate the files for a new day's problem, run:

`.\generate_day.ps1 <year_number> <day_number>`
